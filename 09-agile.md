## What is 'Agile'

'Agile' is a project management methodology, particularly for software development,
built around a 4 point philosophical [manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) 
and a 12 point set of [principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

Agile is typified by small teams that self-organise ('scrum') on how they will 
address a backlog of requested work, in short cycles ('sprints'), by breaking 
problems into small tasks, with frequent feedback and result delivery. It is a
highly iterative approach to planning, that allows for high flexibility and less 
forward planning. A sprint may last 1-4 weeks, in which time an entire cycle of 
planning, designing, implementing, testing and delivering takes place, with small
tasks hopefully addressed to completion, followed by a review and retrospective 
that may or may not end up influencing the next sprint cycle.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The Agile approach is to break problems into smaller tasks and fully address them
in short, iterative work cycles (sprints), with each cycle ending in review and discussion
before planning the next cycle.
- Aspects of this approach may be useful in data science work.
